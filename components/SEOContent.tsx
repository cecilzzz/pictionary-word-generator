          <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Can you make sounds while playing Pictionary?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              No, making sounds is not allowed in traditional Pictionary rules. The drawer must communicate only through drawings. This includes no verbal sounds, humming, or sound effects. However, the drawer can nod or shake their head to indicate if guesses are close or correct.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">What is the difference between Pictionary and charades?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The main difference is the method of communication: Pictionary uses drawing while Charades uses acting and gestures. In Pictionary, players draw pictures to convey words, while in Charades, players act out words using body movements and gestures. Both games prohibit speaking, but the communication methods are completely different.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The standard time limit for Pictionary is 60-90 seconds per turn. Most official rules suggest 60 seconds, but many players prefer 90 seconds for more challenging words. You can adjust the time based on your group&apos;s preference and the difficulty of the words being used.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Absolutely! You don&apos;t need the official Pictionary board game to play. All you need is paper, pencils, and words to draw - which is exactly what our word generator provides. You can create your own scoring system, use a timer on your phone, and have just as much fun as with the official game.
